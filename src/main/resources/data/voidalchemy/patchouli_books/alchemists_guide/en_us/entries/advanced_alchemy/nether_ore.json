Its powers are not one to be meddled with, as in doing so one could cause its lust to grow, and then it would seep into the Overworld, destroying all that we know. Within the crevices of the Nether, there are bits of that extreme power I just mentioned, and such can be cultivated for an alchemist's use."

Such is only speculation and has no tangible evidence behind it."

One of greater wisdom would consider such use a waste, for it can be cultivated into so much more..."
